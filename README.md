# docker-cpp-example

An example to build and debug C++ code in a Docker container using Visual
Studio Code.

Start the enviroment with `docker-compose up`.

The vscode configuration files include tasks to build for debugging and to
launch the debugger.

By default, can build the project with `CTRL+Shift+B` or start debugging with
`F5`.
